 ## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

New methods that allow dapps to interact with all different types of wallets.

 ## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

A collection of methods that can be implemented by any wallet provider (e.g. Web3 JavaScript wallet browsers) that enables advanced interaction for dapps. This will enable the support of new wallet types that are emerging.

 ## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Wallets are the most important interaction point between dapps and the Ethereum chain. Currently the most important wallet methods (`eth_sendTransaction`, `eth_sign` and `eth_signTypedData`) are part of the general api specification. 
For most wallets it does not make sense to provide implementations for all `eth_` methods. Therefore it would make sense to introduce a new prefix `wallet_` (this was already introduced with EIP-1426 / EIP-747).

This will provide the possibility to support new types of wallets. While the current methods are focused on wallets based on externally owned accounts, more and more wallets start to make use of smart contracts. Interacting with smart contract based wallets is different to the interaction with EOA based wallets. The biggest difference is that smart contract based wallets cannot generate ECDSA signatures. Also smart contract based wallets provide the possibility for a lot of extended functionality.

 ## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

The following new methods are provided:

### wallet_getActiveWallet
```javascript
/**
* @returns {Promise} address - The currently active wallet object (should contain the address and information about what type -> e.g. EOA or smart contract)
*/
async  function  wallet_getCurrentAddress () {
  /* Implementation would go here */
}
// Sample usage:
web3.wallet.getCurrentAddress()
```

### wallet_sendTransaction
```javascript
/**
* @param  {Object}  opts - The options specifing the transaction (same as for eth_sendTransaction)
* @returns  {Promise} hash - Transaction hash of the submitted transaction
*/
async  function  wallet_sendTransaction ( opts ) {
/* Implementation would go here */
}
 // Sample usage:
web3.wallet.sendTransaction(opts)
```

### wallet_sign and wallet_signTypedData

TODO: Specify behaviour if not supported by the wallet

```javascript
/**
* @param  {Object}  opts - The options specifing the data that should be signed (same as for eth_sign)
* @returns  {Promise} signature - Signature generated by the wallet for the message
*/
async  function  wallet_sign ( opts ) {
  /* Implementation would go here */
}

/**
* @param  {Object}  opts - The options specifing the data that should be signed (same as for eth_signTypedData)
* @returns  {Promise} signature - Signature generated by the wallet for the message
*/
async  function  wallet_signTypedData ( opts ) {
  /* Implementation would go here */
}

// Sample usage:
web3.wallet.sign(opts)
web3.wallet.signTypedData(opts)
```

### wallet_contractSign, wallet_contractSignTypedData

TODO: Should this be combined with the normal `wallet_sign` and `wallet_signTypedData` and return an object that includes a signature type

TODO: Specify behaviour if not supported by the wallet

TODO: Specify return data exactly (signature is not of a specific length)

See https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1271
```javascript
/**
* @param  {Object}  opts - The options specifing the data that should be signed (same as for eth_sign)
* @returns  {Promise} signature - Signature generated by the wallet for the message
*/
async  function  wallet_contractSign ( opts ) {
  /* Implementation would go here */
}

/**
* @param  {Object}  opts - The options specifing the data that should be signed (same as for eth_signTypedData)
* @returns  {Promise} signature - Signature generated by the wallet for the message
*/
async  function  wallet_contractSignTypedData ( opts ) {
  /* Implementation would go here */
}

// Sample usage:
web3.wallet.contractSign(opts)
web3.wallet.contractSignTypedData(opts)
```

### Potential Additional Methods
- Handling for delegate signing (state channels)
  - `wallet_getDelegateAddress( opts )`
  - `wallet_delegateSign( opts )` and `wallet_delegateSignTypedData( opts )`
  - `wallet_registerDelegateKey( opts )`
- Handling for subscriptions
- Possibility to submit a collection of transactions
- Support for universal login

 ## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

TODO
 
 ## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
